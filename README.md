# Forget Me Nots

## Inspiration
Mental health issues such as Alzheimer's have been a concern for many people. Because of the pandemic situation such as isolation and the lack for remote care, people find it more and more difficult to cope with mental issues and to find ways to prevent them. 

This points to the need to have a site that provides preventive care and assistance for people who have mental issues such as Alzheimer's disease. The site should provide remote assistance and tools to help patients with mental problems to cope with their issues.

With the above requirements in mind, we developed the "Forget Me Nots" site. We want to provide a platform that helps people detect Alzheimer early, avoid Alzheimer, and keep their memories. The site offers free virtual memory scanning, a chat bot that takes schedule time and reminds users ofÂ  appointments for the day, game for training and increasing brain functionality, a writing diary function for users to write and remember their memories, and playlists of songs that users can listen to uplift their moods and share with friends by sending messages. 

## What it does
The site offers reminder function of schedules and appointments for users who have mental issues such as Alzheimer's disease, game to train the brain, a writing diary function for users to write and remember their memories, and Spotify playlists of songs that users can share with friends by sending phone messages. 

## How we built it

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
One of our biggest achievements was creating an app that helps people cope with stress, depression, and mental issues such as Alzheimer's diseases. We want to provide seniors and youths preventive care for Alzheimer's disease through games and music therapy. We was able to offer functions such as free virtual screening memory and feature for users to keep their memory through writing diary, playing games to train the brain, listening to happy songs to relax. 

## What we learned
